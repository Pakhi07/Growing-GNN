# Meta guided Neural Development Program

The idea of this project is to build an AI network that grows during the training process. Now, this growth will be guided using a meta learned model. Meta-training is a method to teach yuor model how to learn. In the experiment I am going to train a self growing network using the features from the meta-learned model. I expect the model to be more adaptive and learn faster than a model that is not guided by the meta-learned model. Excited to analyse and visualise the results once it's trained!
